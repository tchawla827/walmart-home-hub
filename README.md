# Walmart Home Hub

This demo showcases a shopping experience powered by a Flask API and React frontend. Products are stored in a Supabase Postgres database.

## Development

1. Configure environment variables. Copy `frontend/.env.example` to `frontend/.env` and adjust the API URL if your backend runs on a different host.
2. Install backend dependencies with `pip install -r backend/requirements.txt` and start the Flask app.
3. In another terminal run `npm install` inside `frontend` and start the development server with `npm start`.
